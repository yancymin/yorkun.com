    des: `Hello everyone, I am designer YorKun. In fact, my real name is a bit complicated and the input is very troublesome. For the convenience of myself and others, I simply took the current name with a homonym. Everyone called me "york." </br> </br>
    Because I was interested in painting from an early age, I usually spent the weekend in painting classes, then I began to study art in high school. The university studied at the Hubei Academy of Fine Arts. It may be that there are more "experimental" and "pure art" in the learning environment. I am more eager to get close to the visual expression of life. I hope to use the knowledge I have learned to solve the problem. I am keen on digital products, The display screen has a special liking, so the junior decided to learn the UI design, and then naturally entered the industry after graduation.</br> </br>
    Whether it is a firm belief in doing "good" things, or looking for "living" in the sea, I hope that I can always love design, Respect and Struggle.`,
