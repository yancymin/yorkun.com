      `Hey peeps. My name is YorKun. A UI designer and an animation enthusiast. You probably find this name unusual which is coming from my original name, you could simply call me "york".<br/><br/>
       I started to get obsessed with drawing when I was 12, I remember spending a whole weekend in the drawing class at that time. Naturally, I ended up with studying art in high school. From there, I went to Hubei Academy of Fine Arts to continue pursuing my art career.<br/><br/>
       Nowadays, I had a chance to work as a UI designer. I love solving problems with my design mindset and hopefully get exposed with more challenges in the future. Respect & Struggle.`,

      `你好，我叫 YorKun，是一名设计师，从事视觉、界面、动效等设计工作。你可以简单称呼我「右可」。<br/><br/>
       因为对画画感兴趣，我小学时周末通常是在绘画兴趣班度过的，随后高中开始系统的学习美术，大学于湖北美术学院动画系就读。可能是在学习环境中接触「实验性」和「纯艺」比较多，我更向往贴近生活的视觉表现形式，希望利用所学知识来解决实际问题。<br/><br/>
       我希望自己能一直热爱设计并敢于面对更多挑战，持谦逊之心、尽拼搏之力。`,
