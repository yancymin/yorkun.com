      `Hello everyone, I am designer YorKun. In fact, my real name is a bit complicated and the input is very troublesome. For the convenience of myself and others, I simply took the current name with a homonym. Everyone called me "york." </br> </br>
    Because I was interested in painting from an early age, I usually spent the weekend in painting classes, then I began to study art in high school. The university studied at the Hubei Academy of Fine Arts. It may be that there are more "experimental" and "pure art" in the learning environment. I am more eager to get close to the visual expression of life. I hope to use the knowledge I have learned to solve the problem. I am keen on digital products, The display screen has a special liking, so the junior decided to learn the UI design, and then naturally entered the industry after graduation.</br> </br>
    Whether it is a firm belief in doing "good" things, or looking for "living" in the sea, I hope that I can always love design, Respect and Struggle.`

      '关于我',
      `大家好，我是设计师 YorKun。事实上我姓名的字有点儿复杂，以至于输入法里要翻很多页才能找到。为了自己和他人的方便，索性以首字母和谐音取了现在的这个别名，大家更习惯叫我 「右可」。<br/><br/>
               因为从小对画画感兴趣，我小学时周末通常是在绘画兴趣班度过的，随后高中开始系统的学习美术，大学于湖北美术学院动画系就读。可能是在学习环境中接触「实验性」和「纯艺」比较多，我更向往贴近生活的视觉表现形式，希望利用所学知识来解决周身的实际问题，再加上自己对带有显示屏的东西情有独钟，热衷数码产品，所以大三开始学习 UI 设计，毕业后也顺其自然进入到了这个行业。<br/><br/>
                无论是坚定信念做「好」事，还是在大海中寻「活」法，我希望自己能一直热爱设计，持谦逊之心、尽拼搏之力。`
